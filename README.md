NAME
====

API::Discogs - Provide basic API to Discogs

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use API::Discogs;
my $discogs = Discogs.new;

my $release = $discogs.release(249504);
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

API::Discogs provides a Raku library with access to the [Discogs](https://discogs.com) data and functions. It tries to follow the API as closely as possible, so the up-to-date [Discogs developer information](https://www.discogs.com/developers) can be used to look up matters that are unclear from thie documentation in this module.

One exception to this rule is that fieldnames in the JSON generated by Discogs that are using snake_case, are converted to use kebab-case in the Raku interface. So a field called `allows_multiple_values` in the JSON blob, will be accessible using a `allow-multiple-values` method in this module.

UTILITY METHODS
===============

new
---

```raku
my $discogs = Discogs.new(
  client   => $client,     # Cro::HTTP::Client compatible, optional

  key      => "kahgjkhdg", # Discogs access key, default: none
  secret   => "454215642", # Discogs access secret, default: none
  currency => "EUR",       # default: "USD"
  per-page => 10,          # default: 50
;
